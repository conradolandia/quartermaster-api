# Example Trip YAML

# Trips are specific departures within a Mission. Customers book seats on Trips.
# A Mission typically has multiple Trips (e.g., morning and afternoon departures).
# Before importing, ensure the mission_id references an existing Mission.
#
# Required fields: mission_id, type, check_in_time, boarding_time, departure_time
# Optional fields: active

mission_id: "c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-cdef-345678901234"  # Replace with actual Mission UUID
type: "boat"  # Trip type (e.g., "boat", "bus", "vip")

# Times should allow enough buffer between each phase
check_in_time: "2024-06-15T15:00:00Z"   # Guests arrive and check in
boarding_time: "2024-06-15T15:45:00Z"   # Begin boarding the vessel
